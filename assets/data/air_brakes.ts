O\\ 1/2 inch
O\\ 1 inch
O\\ 1-1/2 inches
A\\ 1 inch
E\\ Park on level ground and chock the wheels to prevent the vehicle from moving, release the parking brakes so you can move the slack adjusters, using gloves and pull hard on each slack adjuster that you can reach, and if a slack adjuster moves more than about one inch where the push rod attaches to it then adjustments are needed.

Q\\ What is the best way to test your vehicle's low air pressure warning signal?
O\\ With the engine off, step on and off the brake pedal to lower the air pressure below 60 psi.
O\\ Pump the brakes while your vehicle is fully on.
O\\ Pump the brakes until the air pressure drops below 30 psi.
O\\ Manually let the air out of your brakes and see if the signal comes on.
A\\ With the engine off, step on and off the brake pedal to lower the air pressure below 60 psi.
E\\ Shut the engine off when you have enough air pressure so that the low-pressure warning signal is not on. Turn the electrical power on and step on and off the brake pedal to reduce air tank pressure. The low air pressure warning signal must come on before the pressure drops to less than 60 psi in the air tank.

Q\\ On a long or steep downgrade, once you have reached your "safe" speed, brake until you are traveling
O\\ 5 mph slower.
O\\ 15 mph slower.
O\\ 10 mph slower.
A\\ 5 mph slower.
E\\ Snub braking method is used for steep downhill grades, in this method apply the brakes just hard enough to feel a definite slowdown. When your speed has been reduced to approximately five mph below your "safe" speed, release the brakes. When your speed has increased to your "safe" speed, repeat.

Q\\ Air braking takes more time than hydraulic braking because air brakes:
O\\ Use different brake drums.
O\\ Need to have airflow through the lines to work.
O\\ Require heavier return springs.
A\\ Need to have airflow through the lines to work.
E\\ With air brakes there is an added delay called Brake Lag. This is the time required for the brakes to work after the brake pedal is pushed.

O\\ will close automatically if the air supply drops to a certain level.
O\\ will close if you apply the parking brakes.
O\\ provides the air supply for the brake system.
O\\ does all of the above.
A\\ does all of the above.
E\\ The tractor protection valve keeps air in the tractor or truck brake system should the trailer break away or develop a bad leak, and it will close automatically if air pressure is low (typically 20-45 psi).

O\\ Every time you leave your vehicle, with a few exceptions
O\\ Only in urban areas where there are many other vehicles
O\\ Every time you leave your vehicle for any length of time
A\\ Every time you leave your vehicle, with a few exceptions
E\\ Never leave your vehicle unattended without applying the parking brakes or chocking the wheels. Your vehicle might roll away and cause injury and damage. Exceptions are when the brakes are very hot, or wet and it is very cold outside. In this case use wheel chocks.

O\\ Has been used in this trip.
O\\ Is in the air tanks.
O\\ Is being sent to the brake chambers.
A\\ Is in the air tanks.
E\\ All vehicles with air brakes have a pressure gauge connected to the air tank, and it tells you how much pressure is in the air tanks.

Q\\ Which of the following is NOT part of the drum brake?
O\\ Slack adjuster
O\\ Brake drum
O\\ Return spring
O\\ Safety valve
A\\ Safety valve
E\\ Drum brakes are on each of your vehicle's axles and contain about 10 different parts, including the axle, slack adjuster, and brake drum itself. While a safety valve is part of the air brake system, it is not part of the drum brake.

Q\\ The safety release valve will blow at _____ psi?
O\\ 120
O\\ 150
O\\ 160
A\\ 150
E\\ A safety relief valve is installed in the first tank the air compressor pumps air to. The safety valve protects the tank and the rest of the system from too much pressure. The valve is usually set to open at 150 psi. If the safety valve releases air, something is wrong. Have the fault fixed by a mechanic.

Q\\ In an emergency stop you should?
O\\ Use the hand valve and service brakes.
O\\ Use the stab braking method
O\\ Use the brakes hard without locking the wheels.
A\\ Use the stab braking method
E\\ Stab braking means that you: apply your brakes all the way, and release brakes when wheels lock up. As soon as the wheels start rolling, apply the brakes fully again.

Q\\ What are spring brakes?
O\\ If the air brakes leak down, springs apply the brakes to stop the vehicle.
O\\ They are the CamLaster brakes.
O\\ They are the springs on the brake pedal.
A\\ If the air brakes leak down, springs apply the brakes to stop the vehicle.
E\\ When driving, powerful springs are held back by air pressure. If the air pressure is removed, the springs put on the brakes. A leak in the air brake system, which causes all the air to be lost, will also cause the springs to put on the brakes.
